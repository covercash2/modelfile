# `modelfile`

[![build](https://github.com/covercash2/modelfile/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/covercash2/modelfile/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A parser and serder compatible stucture
for Ollama [Modelfile]s written in Rust. ðŸ¦€

The [Modelfile] format isn't based on any existing format.

The parser is basedon the [`nom`] crate
and tested on a few distinct [Modelfile]s.
If you find a [Modelfile] that doesn't parse,
please open an issue!
